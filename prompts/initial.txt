I need your help to develop a project with requirements below.

Codebase
- Based on Next.js App Router
- Uses AWS Amplify and UI components.
- Developed using Typescript
- Supports linting with eslint
- Cognito, DynamoDB, Lambda functions are the basic components
- Uses Tailwind CSS and Tailwind UI components.

Project:
- A recyclling project that tracks the user's contibution via the QR code scans through the smart trachcans.
- Users collect credits on each scan.
- The current point and latest scans are displayed with a nice looking clean dashboard.
- Application provides a marketplace where users can spend their credits on different options like donating to NGOs.
- The application administrator can add the marketplace items in a pr.viledged area.
- When users scan the QR code it will open the application with a token in the url.
- It will allow the user to create an account or sign in.
- The token should be kept in the query until it's tracked by the application.

We need to make a step by step plan to make sure each iteration is consistent with the requirements.
Now let's make the plan but not start coding until we have a clear plan.
